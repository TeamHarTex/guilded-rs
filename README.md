# guilded-rs (MAINTENANCE MODE)

It has been a fun time developing this project. However, there are other projects to focus on and life is important...
So yeah, guilded-rs is now entering maintenance mode. No major updates will be added.

`guilded-rs` is a powerful, flexible, and scalable ecosystem of Rust libraries for the Guilded API.
